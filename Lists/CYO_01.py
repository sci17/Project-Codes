# 1. What is printed by the following statements?
# s= "python rocks"
# print(s[3])
# it printed the 'h' because if we count from left and started from zero up to 3 it will land on 'h' just like what the statement is trying to do.

# 2. What is printed by the following statements?
# s="python rocks"
# print(s[2] + s[-4])
# it printed the 'to' because in the statement it tells that we need to count from left starting to zero up to 2 and that lands in 't'. Next we need to count from right since it is negative and  if we count from right it will start from -1 up tp -4 that will land in 'o'. After that the outcome will be added just like in the statment that's why we got the output 'to'.

# 3. What is printed by the following statements?
# alist= [3, 67, "cat", [56,57,"dog"], [], 3.14, False]
# print(alist[5])
# it printed the 3.14, because in the statement it tells that we need to count from left starting from zero up to 5 and i will land to 3.14 since those elements in another bracket inside the another will be counted as one element only.

# 4. Assign the value of the 34th element of lst to the variable output.
# lst= ["hi","morning", "dog", "506","caterpillar","balloons",106, "yo-yo", "python","moon","water","sleepy", "daffy", 45, "donald","whiteboard","glasses","markers", "couches","butterfly","100","magazine", "door", "picture","window",["Olympics","handle"], "chair", "pages", "readings", "burger","juggle","craft",["store", "poster", "board"], "laptop", "computer", "plates","hotdog","salad","backpack", "zipper","ring", "watches","fimger", "bags","boxes","pods","peas","apples","horse","guinea pig","bowl","EECS"]
# print(lst[34])
# it printed the 'computer' since the statement tells that we need to assign the value of 34th element of lst and we started to count from left starting from zero up to 34 and it landed in 'computer' as the 34th element.

# 5. Assign the value of the last character of lst to the variable output. Do this so that the lenght of lst doesn't matter.
lst= "Every chess or checkers game begin from the same position and has a finite number of moves that can be played. While the number of possible scenarios and moves is quite large, it is still possible for computers to calculate that number and even be programmed to respond well against a human player..."
print(len(lst))
# the lenght will show the number of characters in a string in this statement it has a 300 characters in a string.
